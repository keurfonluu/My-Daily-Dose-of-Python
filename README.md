# My Daily Dose of Python

Simple repo where I upload my solutions to coding tests from [Daily Interview Pro](https://www.techseries.dev/daily) simply not to get too rusty algorithmically.

I do not guarentee that my solutions to be the best or even work for every possible cases. Nevertheless, I try to respect time and space complexity constraints if any, or solve the tests with the least complexity otherwise. I allow myself to use basic Python features (e.g. ``list``, ``tuple``, ``dict``, ``set``,  ``enumerate``, ``zip``...) and try not to use more advanced libraries (e.g. ``itertools``, ``numpy``...).
